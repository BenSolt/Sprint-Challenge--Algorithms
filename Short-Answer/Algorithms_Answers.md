#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n)
n is increasing at constant rate.


b) Logarithmic O(log n)
runtime will grow at a slightly slower rate.



c)  Linear O(n)
if have 3 bunnyEars counts down by 1 each run through. which is constant

## Exercise II



def egg(n):
  f = 7s
  while f < n:
    print(f)
    f += 1

 Time is 0(n) 
Space is 0(1)
