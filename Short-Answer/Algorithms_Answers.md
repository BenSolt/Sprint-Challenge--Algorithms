#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Logarithmic O(log n)
input incrases, runtime grows at slightly slower rate.


b) Polynomial O(n**c)
A for loop or in this case, a while loop, nested withen a for loop.


c) Exponential O(c**n)
As input increases, Runtime grows at a faster rate.

## Exercise II
